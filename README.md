# SSR-with-resampling
R Code for the article "Improving sample size recalculation in adaptive clinical trials by resampling" by Carolin Herrmann, Corinna Kluge, Maximilian Pilz, Meinhard Kieser and Geraldine Rauch (doi: 10.1002/PST_2122). 

* **What the project does**: \
This is the R code used for the simulations in the manuscript "Improving sample size recalculation in adaptive clinical trials by resampling" (doi: 10.1002/PST_2122).

* **Why the project is useful**: \
In the above-mentioned article, the authors propose resampling elements in the sample size recalculation strategy to deal with the uncertainty of the observed interim effect. 

* **How users can get started with the project**: \
Download the uploaded R-files and run "Standard_Sim.R" as well as "Elbphi_Sim.R" for the simulations.

* **Where users can get help with your project**: \
Background knowledge on the implemented theory can be found in "Improving sample size recalculation in adaptive clinical trials by resampling" (doi: 10.1002/PST_2122).

* **Who maintains and contributes to the project**: \
The code was written by Corinna Kluge, Carolin Herrmann and Geraldine Rauch.
